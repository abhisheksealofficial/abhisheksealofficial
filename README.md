I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications. I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, and PHP. I love problem-solving, learning new technologies, and bringing ideas to life through code.

During my Front-End Development Internship at IBM (June 2024 - July 2024, Remote), I worked on developing an Amazon Front-End Clone using HTML and CSS. This internship provided me with hands-on experience in UI/UX design, responsiveness, and clean coding practices while working on a structured project. One of my key projects, the Amazon Clone â€“ Full Stack Development, allowed me to build a fully functional e-commerce front-end, focusing on user experience, responsiveness, and smooth design implementation. I am proficient in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development with PHP, Python, C, and C++. I also have experience with Git, GitHub, and VS Code, ensuring smooth collaboration and version control in my development process.

I earned a Full-Stack Development Certification from Aptech Learning, Kolkata (June 2022 - June 2024), which helped me strengthen my technical expertise and broaden my knowledge in software development. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from Supreme Knowledge Foundation Group of Institutions, Kolkata, under Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology (2022 - 2025). My soft skills, including problem-solving, analytical thinking, communication, teamwork, time management, and leadership, allow me to adapt quickly to new challenges and collaborate effectively with teams.

I am always looking to build, learn, and grow in the field of software development. I love working on real-world projects that challenge me to think critically and innovate. Whether itâ€™s developing front-end designs or handling back-end logic, I am committed to writing clean, efficient code that makes an impact.
